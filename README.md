# Introduction

This is the repository to go along with my bachelor's thesis, **Exploring Design Decisions in Issue Tracking Systems for Projects in Different Software Domains**. It contains all statistics code and results, including results not shown in the thesis itself due to lack of space and overabundance of results.

Both subfolders have a respective readme that explains their contents - both scripts and data present - in more detail.

# Folder `helper_scripts`

This folder contains scripts that I used to gather or transform raw statistics results to fit into the thesis and make my own life easier.

# Folder `statistics`

This folder contains all the statistics scripts and data used to generate result graphics and tables.
